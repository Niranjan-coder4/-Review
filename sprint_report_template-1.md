## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

We had to learn how to code a basic frontend, we overcame this by watching some youtube videos that we found and to connect the frontend and backend so they are in sync. We also learned through using AI, ChatGPT, to teach us and ask questions about some questions about the frontend and backend connections. Like: How does the frontend communicate with the backend? How do you document your backend endpoints so frontend developers can use them effectively? How do you prevent common security issues like CORS errors?

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
  * Item x
  * We were able to sucessfully have two working functunaitlites during this sprint, we were able to create a login UI and a place where the user can upload their files and have the AI review to code.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Item 1
   * Item 2
   * Item x
   * We need to improve on being communicative with eachother, there were some times where we werent able to get updates from eachother. Maybe creating a more flexable time slots for eachof us would solve this issue.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Item 1
   * Item 2
   * Item x
   * We plan to implement a proper conection between the login page and the dashboard of features that will be avalable for the user.
   * We also plan to add a feature where the Teacher and students can be viewed in the dashboard and have specific functunalities that the teacher well have.
   * Like adding students and removing them. Having the option to check the code that the student uploaded.
   * We also like to have more UI friendly design.
